# Metaverse
How it will be....


The Metaverse's core will be decentralized and open source on Web 3.0 supported by every Blockchains as they will be acting naturally without planified consensus, more as super-representatives to ensure the integrity of the entities (data) in the universes as what we first believe would be a kind of protection.

The Blockchains reputations and ranking as representative models to valide the integrity of Web 3.0 will remove every rights to any entity to own the metaverse as we call it now.

Many corrupted blockchains will integrate objects that are not supposed to be there. It will be at this moment spreading the biggest WTF situations of all times!

When Metaverse will have another name given by community, every blockchains will contribute in their own ways to it! The creativity from a blockchain to heal this environment will rank them up or down.
